Feel free to go through them.The naming of the solution is roughly the same as the problem listed on striver's sheet or its leetcode problem. All the solutions provided here are standalone functions as they tend to be in leetcode problems, all of the have been accepted.the series is not complete yet and i will try my best to complete the series and make the solutions availabl :)
